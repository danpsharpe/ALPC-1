# Part 1: Encoding and Decoding Values

For this task, you need to write a small program including a pair of functions that can
1. convert an integer into a special text encoding and then
2. convert the encoded value back into the original integer.

Assuming that your solution works correctly and cleanly enough to move forward in this process, these
functions will need to be used in your part 2 submission.

## The Encoding Function
This function needs to accept a signed integer in the 14-bit range [-8192..+8191] and return a 4 character
string.

The encoding process is as follows:
1. Add `8192` to the raw value, so its range is translated to [0..16383]
2. Pack that value into two bytes such that the most significant bit of each is cleared **Unencoded intermediate value (as a 16-bit integer):**
    `00HHHHHH HLLLLLLL` Encoded value: `0HHHHHHH 0LLLLLLL`

3. Format the two bytes as a single 4-character hexadecimal string and return it
Sample values:

|   Unencoded (decimal)   |   Intermediate (decimal)  |   Intermediate (hex)  |   Encoded (hex)   |
|   --------------------- |:-------------------------:| ---------------------:| -----------------:|
|   0                     | 8192                      | 2000                  | 4000              |
|-8192 |    0 | 0000 | 0000 |
|8191 | 16383 | 3fff |  7F7F |
|2048 | 10240 | 2800 |  5000 |
|-4096 |    4096 | 1000 |  2000 |

## The Decoding Function
Your decoding function should accept two bytes on input, both in the range [0x00..0x7F] and recombine them to return the corresponding integer between [-8192..+8191]

|   Hi byte |   Lo byte |   Value   |
|   ------- |:---------:|   -------:|
|   40 | 00 | 0 |
|   00 | 00 | -8192 |
|   7F | 7F | 8191  |
|   50 | 00 | 2048  |
|   0A | 05 | -6907 |
|   55 | 00 | 2688  |

# Your Task
You should supply source code (and whatever additional collateral files may be necessary or useful for us to
understand, validate, and test your submission) for a working program that can accept text input in either
decimal integer or hexadecimal format and convert between the two formats.

This program can be a command line application that reads from stdin or a file and writes to stdout or a file,
or could be a web page or mobile/desktop app that uses a text edit box to accept input values by typing or
pasting (or loading a file) and a button to convert that input into the desired output format so you can
encode/decode sample data as described below.

This program must be written using one of our preferred programming languages:
* C++
* C#
* JavaScript
* Java (see below)
* Objective-C
* PHP
* Python
* Swift

Please don't submit solutions in Java unless you are specifically asking to be considered as an Android
developer.

We'd prefer that you limit the use of any third-party libraries or frameworks where possibleâ€”remember that
the goal here is to help us see how awesome your code can be when you're working on a problem where
none of those libraries exist yet.

Your completed submission will be evaluated by a senior Art+Logic developer, who will be looking for several
- things, but most importantly:
- Does this code work correctly?
- Is it well designed and cleanly implemented?
- Was it completed in a reasonable amount of time?
- If I had to maintain this code, would that make me happy or angry?

To help us verify that your code works correctly, please include a plain text file in your submission package
named "ConvertedData.txt" that contains encoded values for these integers:
* 6111
* 340
* -2628
* -255
* 7550

And decoded integers for these hexadecimal values:
* 0A0A
* 0029
* 3F0F
* 4400
* 5E7F
